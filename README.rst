Cassandra - Dylan Client
========================

This is a client for communicating with the `Cassandra`_ database
software written in `Dylan`_.

It will implement the binary protocol (not the Thrift-based protocol)
and work with CQL3.

It will, in the future, work with the database abstraction layer
present in Open Dylan as well.
